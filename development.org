This document describes Getting Started-style notes and receipes for
development.

** GNU Emacs and GNU Screen

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

** NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute

See [[https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+C-RX-02+V1]["Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano"]] for introductory
information. Example code is in /srv/nvdli-nano and symlinked from the
jetbot user home directory. The OS image starts Jupyter Lab at boot by
default on port 8888. It is running as the jetbot user. It can be
accessed remotely via port forwarding. A good starting point is
nvdli-nano/hello_camera, which test the camera feed.
