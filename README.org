* Insect Laser Fence

** Abstract

The purpose of this repository is to organize resources for
implementation of a laser fence that targets insects, including the
mosquito and spotted lanternfly. A research question is to determine
if work done on laser fences that target mosquitos in Africa could be
adapted to spotted lanternfly in Pennsylvania. Note that the original
mosquito use case was popularized in 2010 and described as a failure
in 2016 (Schiller, 2016).

** Mosquito Characterization

| Characteristic          | Value                | Source     |
|-------------------------+----------------------+------------|
| Average Flying Altitude | 2 meters             | Kare, 2010 |
| Supply                  | âˆž                    | Kare, 2010 |
| Size                    | < 2 centimeters      | Kare, 2010 |
| Speed                   | < 1 meter per second | Kare, 2010 |

** Spotted Lanternfly Characterization

"As early as July, adults can be seen, and they mate and lay eggs from
late September through the onset of winter." (Wikipedia 2020)
Therefore, a system that target adults should be placed into service
from July through the onset of winter.

TODO - Translate size to requirements for identification  

TODO - Translate speed to requirements for response time  

** Candidate Design - Optical Recognition Laser Turret

A candidate design could be a single laser turret. Optical image
recognition might be used for target identification. A mounted laser
would then be aimed and fired. A candidate use case would be
deployment of the turret in a area with moderate to high density of
spotted lanternfly. The turret would be manned and operated in a
semi-autonomous mode. Semi-autonomous deployment would mitigate safety
and weather challenges.
