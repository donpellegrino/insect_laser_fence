* Insect Laser Fence

** Abstract

The purpose of this repository is to organize resources for
implementation of a laser fence that targets insects, including the
mosquito and spotted lanternfly. A research question is to determine
if work done on laser fences that target mosquitos in Africa could be
adapted to spotted lanternfly in Pennsylvania. Note that the original
mosquito use case was popularized in 2010 and described as a failure
in 2016 (Schiller, 2016).

** Target Characterizations
*** Mosquito

| Characteristic           | Value                | Source     |
|--------------------------+----------------------+------------|
| Average Flying Altitude  | 2 meters             | Kare, 2010 |
| Supply                   | âˆž                    | Kare, 2010 |
| Size                     | < 2 centimeters      | Kare, 2010 |
| Speed                    | < 1 meter per second | Kare, 2010 |
| Lethal Energy Dose Req'd | > 50 mJ in 3 ms      | Kare, 2010 |

*** Spotted Lanternfly

"As early as July, adults can be seen, and they mate and lay eggs from
late September through the onset of winter." (Wikipedia 2020)
Therefore, a system that target adults should be placed into service
from July through the onset of winter.

| Characteristic          | Value               | Source                       |
|-------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------|
| Average Flying Altitude | TODO                |                              |
| Supply                  | "killem killem all" | https://youtu.be/1g82I7w3ENU |
| Size                    | TODO                |                              |
| Speed                   | TODO                |                              |

TODO - Translate size to requirements for identification

TODO - Translate speed to requirements for response time

** Candidate Designs
*** Nuke the Entire Site from Orbit

This is the only way to be sure (https://youtu.be/nnHmUk_J6xQ). Note
that this is assumed to be preferrable to nerve gas. However, the
installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it and the
action may not be authorized.

*** Optical Recognition Laser Turret

A candidate design could be a single laser turret. Optical image
recognition might be used for target identification. A mounted laser
would then be aimed and fired. A candidate use case would be
deployment of the turret in a area with moderate to high density of
spotted lanternfly. The turret would be manned and operated in a
semi-autonomous mode. Semi-autonomous deployment would mitigate safety
and weather challenges.

             prevent firing beams ouside of the desired area. Note
             that many lasers may have temperature limits beyond
             typical ambient summer temperature in the target area of
             operations.
