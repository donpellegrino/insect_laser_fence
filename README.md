# Insect Laser Fence

## Abstract

The purpose of this repository is to organize resources for implementation of a laser fence that targets insects, including the mosquito and spotted lanternfly. A research question is to determine if work done on laser fences that target mosquitos in Africa could be adapted to spotted lanterfly in Pennsylvania.

## Mosqiuto Characterization

Average Flying Altitude: 2 meters (Kare 2010)  
Supply: âˆž (Kare 2010)  
Size: < 2 centimeters (Kare 2010)  
Speed: < 1 meter per second (Kare 2010)  

## Spotted Lanterfly Characterization

"As early as July, adults can be seen, and they mate and lay eggs from late September through the onset of winter." (Wikipedia 2020) Therefore, a system that target adults should be placed into service from July through the onset of winter.

Aberage FLying Altitude: TODO  
Supply: "killem killem all" (https://youtu.be/1g82I7w3ENU)  
Size: TODO - Translate to requirements for identification  
Speed: TODO - Translate to requirements for response time
